Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm [Joel]. I'm the founder of shubox.io. How are you?

It's been several months since I shared anything about shubox.io being something I was working on. I
have spent the majority of my spare time this winter and spring working on so many facets of the
application and keeping my head down - I didn't think I had a whole lot to share. 

But now? I believe shubox is ready to flip the sign around to "open" and enthusiastically welcome
everyone to the app - we're ready for business.

Let me first give some context as to what shubox.io will strive to be.

I want it to be the easiest, quickest, and most painless way to allow your users -- whether they are
your end-users, or your internal team -- to upload images to S3. Let me unpack a few points there.
Yes - we are built with S3 specifically in mind. I am one of many who feel that as far as asset
hosting is concerned - S3 is the beginning and end of the conversation. It's reliable, it's
inexpensive for most use cases, and its ubiquitous. You have an S3 bucket or two to spare, right?
You will be serving your files from your own S3 account. I believe that ownership of your assets is
important. I don't want my files living in someone else's buckets. In addition - this allows shubox
to keep our costs low. That is by no means a trivial point ðŸ˜„.

To start out, shubox will be focusing on images as our main asset. I can certainly see this evolving
to something that may accept PDF's and do some fancy OCR. Don't hold me to it! But there are still
aspirations.

I believe that the tools and the infrastructure closely aligns with what web developers are
utilizing today. These are the tools *I*, and many around me, have reached for, consistently, for years.

Considering the above points - I would like you to ask yourself "Does my, or my client's app, accept
image uploads? Are uploads taking too long? Are uploads taking up too much of our server
resources? Are you too often fiddling with code around all your file uploads?"

If so - I really think shubox can help you! Go ahead - [give it a shot]!
