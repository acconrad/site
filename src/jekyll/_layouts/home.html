        <p>
          When we needed image uploads for a messaging area on a client site,
          we decided to try out Shubox — just for a month initially. Our
          rationale was: quicker to deliver to client, more time left to spend
          on the unique issues of the app, and less code in our repo, so easier
          to maintain. Our plan was we would migrate away from Shubox when we
          had some feature that they couldn’t provide, or when the price payoff
          didn’t work any more. We just haven’t needed to migrate — judging
          from client satisfaction and developer team happiness, this has been
          a good choice.

          Shubox is a super easy way to upload files to S3. I love that I didn't have to build in file management into my app and I could just focus on what was important to my customers.
