  <h2 class="headline">Structural Elements</h2>
  <p>There are a handful of structural elements that are frequently used throughout the site and use shorthand classes for ease-of-use:</p>

  <h3>Container: <code>.c</code></h3>
  <p>When applied to a <code>div</code> or any other <code>html</code> element, it will apply the standard site margins to that element's children. You should avoid nesting containers inside other containers.</p>

  <h3>Wrapper: <code>.w</code></h3>
  <p>This is a generic utility class that has no base style. It is typically used to group pieces of content.</p>

  <h3>Block: <code>.b</code></h3>
  <p>The block class is typically applied blocks to achieve consistent spacing.</p>

  <h3>Grid and Grid Item: <code>.g .gi</code></h3>
  <p>These classes are used in the <a href="/library/elements/">responsive grid typographysystem</a> heavily throughout the site.</p>

  <h2 class="headline">Blocks</h2>
  <p>These components that are composed of a Jekyll includes in <code>/src/jekyll/_includes</code>, a Sass file in <code>src/styles/_block</code> which is has an API that can be used statically in templates to compose pages throughout the site.</p>

  <h2 class="headline">Layouts</h2>
